Consider a \(2025 \times 2025\) grid of unit squares. An urban planner wishes to place on the grid some rectangular buildings, possibly of different sizes, such that each side of every building lies on a grid line and every unit square is covered by at most one building.

Determine the minimum number of buildings the planner needs to place so that each row and each column of the grid has exactly one unit square that is not covered by any building (a park square).
