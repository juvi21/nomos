A strict factor of a positive integer \(M\) is any positive divisor of \(M\) excluding \(M\) itself.

An infinite sequence \(s_1,s_2,\dots\) consists of positive integers each of which has at least three strict factors. Suppose that for each \(n \ge 1\),
\[
s_{n+1} = \text{(sum of the three largest strict factors of } s_n).
\]
Determine all possible values of \(s_1\).
