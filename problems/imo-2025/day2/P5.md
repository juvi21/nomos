Max and Leo are playing the **Vector Duel**, a two-player game whose rules depend on a positive real number \(\alpha\) known to both players. On the \(n\)-th turn of the game (starting with \(n=1\)), the following happens:

- If \(n\) is odd, Max chooses a nonnegative real number \(v_n\) such that
\[
v_1 + v_2 + \cdots + v_n \le \alpha n.
\]

- If \(n\) is even, Leo chooses a nonnegative real number \(v_n\) such that
\[
v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2 \le n.
\]

If a player cannot choose a suitable \(v_n\), the game ends and the other player wins. If the game goes on forever, neither player wins. All chosen numbers are known to both players.

Determine all values of \(\alpha\) for which Max has a winning strategy and all those for which Leo has a winning strategy.
