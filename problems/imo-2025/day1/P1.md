A line in the plane is called a **charged beam** if it is not parallel to any of the \(x\)-axis, the \(y\)-axis, or the line \(x+y=0\).

Let \(N \ge 3\) be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers \(k\) such that there exist \(N\) distinct lines in the plane satisfying both of the following:

- for all positive integers \(u\) and \(v\) with \(u+v \le N+1\), the point \((u,v)\) lies on at least one of the lines; and
- exactly \(k\) of the \(N\) lines are charged beams.
