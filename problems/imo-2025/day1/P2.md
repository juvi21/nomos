Let \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) be circles with centres \(O_1\) and \(O_2\), respectively, such that the radius of \(C_1\) is less than the radius of \(C_2\). Suppose \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) intersect at two distinct points \(X\) and \(Y\). Line \(O_1 O_2\) intersects \(C_1\) at \(U\) and \(C_2\) at \(V\), so that \(U, O_1, O_2, V\) lie on \(O_1 O_2\) in that order. Let \(Z\) be the circumcenter of triangle \(UXV\). Line \(XZ\) meets \(C_1\) again at \(S \ne X\) and meets \(C_2\) again at \(T \ne X\). Let \(K\) be the orthocenter of triangle \(Z O_1 O_2\).

Prove that the line through \(K\) parallel to \(XZ\) is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle \(YST\).
